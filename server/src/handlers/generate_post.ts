    // This is a placeholder declaration! Real code should be implemented here.
    // The goal of this handler is to generate a LinkedIn post using AI based on the provided input.
    // It should integrate with an AI service (like OpenAI GPT) to create engaging LinkedIn content
    // based on topic, key points, target audience, tone, and desired post length.

    const placeholderContent = `ðŸš€ Exciting insights on ${topic}!

${keyPoints.map(point => `âœ… ${point}`).join('\n')}

Perfect for ${targetAudience} looking to stay ahead in today's market.
